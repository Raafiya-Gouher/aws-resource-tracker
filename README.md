## AWS Resource Tracker with Cron Job

This project provides a **Bash shell script** that automatically tracks AWS resources such as **EC2 Instances, S3 Buckets, IAM Users, and Lambda Functions**.  
The script generates daily logs of AWS resources and stores them in a `logs/` directory. It also includes **log rotation** to keep only the last 7 days of logs.
